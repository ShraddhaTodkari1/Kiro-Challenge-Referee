# ⚖️ The Referee: React vs. Next.js Trade-off Tool
### Kiro Heroes Week 6 Challenge

## 🎯 Project Overview
This tool is a "Referee" designed to provide neutral, data-driven comparisons between **React** and **Next.js**. Instead of picking a favorite, it helps developers understand the trade-offs in SEO, Performance, and Developer Experience.

## 🤖 Built with Kiro
Using **Kiro's Spec-Driven Development**, I defined strict "Neutrality Rules" in the `/.kiro` directory. This ensures the AI remains an unbiased judge.

## ✅ Verification
- **GitHub Actions:** Passing (Green Checkmark)
- **Framework:** Python
- **Steering:** Kiro .spec & .kiro directory
